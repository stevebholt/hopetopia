**9/12/2022** The Adult Human Services includes mental health programs that provide a mix of subsidies (through a mental health insurance supplement for low-income, employed residents) and direct service provision (through the operation of a mental health clinic in each quadrant for low-income, unemployed residents). Adult Human Services also operate workforce development programs (basic job training for entry level jobs and job placement assistance for entry-level jobs with a focus on long-term unemployed and formerly incarcerated residents). Finally, Adult Human Services operate three substance abuse treatment clinics to help provide treatment and support for those struggling with drug or alcohol addictions.
