## Current Staffing


## Current Operations Budget
@tbl-budgetfdall22 provides an overview of the FY22 budget proposed by the mayor and passed by the city council. The mayor's proposed budget allocated a 23,959,600 budgetary increase to the Police and Fire departments. Although the Fire Department requested more resources, the mayor proposed a 10,000,000 increase in the operations budget. After a month of general public forums in each ward, we have identified timely inspections as a priority for the coming year. Accordingly, we have allocated an additional 8,000,000 to prevention and inspections and an additional 2,000,000 in professional development to hire and train additional fire safety inspectors throughout the city. @tbl-fdops22 summarizes out allocations for the coming year.
