## Current Operations Budget

@tbl-budgetfdall23 provides an overview of the FY23 budget proposed by the mayor and passed by the city council. The mayor's proposed budget allocated steady funding to the Department of Emergency Services. Although the Fire Department requested more resources, the mayor and Executive Director of the Department of Emergency Services reduced the Fire Department budget by 500,000. After a month of meeting with fire apparatus technicians, families young children in the community, and residents in rural parts of our service area, we have decided to maintain efforts on maintaining our fleet of fire engines for longevity and our current inspection levels. We have absorbed the cut in our operations budget by scaling back available overtime.
