## Current Operations Budget
@tbl-gsbudget22 lays out our budget for the coming fiscal year. The Mayor proposed a 13,316,000 increase in our budget. After holding a public meeting in each of the wards, we have decided to focus our efforts on expanding the number of parks in the city - particularly in the less dense Southwest Ward - and improvements to the streetlights and traffic lights throughout the city.
