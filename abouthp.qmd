**9/12/2022** The head of the HPA has been prioritizing acquiring and rehabilitating abandoned properties in the NW quadrant for the last two years. The program prioritizes residential units and after rehabilitation, manages the units directly and offers both market rate and subsidized units. Recently, the market rate units have been experiencing vacancy rates as many other services and businesses are not convenient to the SW quadrant. Real Estate partners have also noted that the home ownership development programs are often insufficiently funded for SW residents given their economic need. As a result, most of the program helps first time home buyers in the SE and NW quadrants.
