Our mission is to maintain and expand a network of bus routes, and roads so all residents and employees have access to all that our city has to offer.

**10/6/2022** In conjunction with city-wide efforts to improve services, the Transportation Department has identified three performance goals that it will begin tracking and reporting publicly. 1. Ensuring an on-time bus system throughout the city. 2. Minimizing pot holes or closures. 3. Safer streets for all modes through traffic calming designs and streetlight improvements.

**9/12/2022** The Transportation Department operates an extensive city-wide bus system as well as maintaining the roads and approving the design and construction of new roads and bridges. In recent years, cuts have made operating the bus system difficult. Two years ago, you had to reduce the number of busses on routes in the NW and SE quadrants. The service reductions have led to complaints of wait times as high as 60 minutes in those quadrants and you have seen a decline 10% decline in ridership city wide. The biggest ridership declines have come from the NE quadrant, though the reason is unclear. You've also been receiving a variety of complaints about road quality and streetlight outages in the NW quadrant.
