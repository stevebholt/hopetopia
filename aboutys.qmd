<!---# ### How We're Doing

@tbl-ysperf summarizes our current status on our new goals. The satisfaction grade is based on parent survey averages aggregated to the ward-level on scale of 0 to 100. Parents are prompted to grade the services they have received overall. Our child protection services investigate 2,400 reports of child abuse per year, with each ward ranging between 400 and 800 cases per year.
