Your primary campaign focus was increasing housing affordability and attracting businesses back to the Northwest quadrant. In a narrow primary win, the mayor assembled a coalition of support from the Northwest and Northeast quadrants, while a slim advantage in the southwest quadrant made the difference. Below is a summary of the city’s finances."

    "text": "The city of Hopetopia is a square grid that is roughly 14 miles by 16 miles with a population of 350,000 residents. The grid is divided into four quadrants, with downtown and city hall resting in the center of the city. Each quadrant has 4 roughly equally sized districts, each with a representative on the city council (for a total of 16 council members) and each district has 2-3 neighborhoods with linked economic and residential interests with neighborhood associations who often lobby on their behalf. Broadly, the city economy is propelled by 3 colleges in the city, one of which is a community college and one of which is an elite Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) college, a few tech manufacturing and engineering firms, and a robust service sector.\n\n\nThe Northwest quadrant of Hopetopia is highly populated, demographically mixes, but very low income section of the city beset by problems and resource needs. The quadrant has widespread poverty, crumbling roads in many neighborhoods, an increasing supply of abandoned and condemned properties, and frequent complaints about the quality of the schools. Recently, several businesses have left the quadrant, including 1 of the 2 primary grocers, leaving residents with less access to food than other parts of the city. The quadrant also contains two homeless shelters and three substance abuse recovery centers.\n\n\n\nThe Northeast quadrant is a demographically and socioeconomically mixed neighborhood and houses a robust set of bars, restaurants, and small to medium sized retailers. The schools in the quadrant are average schools and the largest private employer in the region, Sid’s Software Co. (a tech company), is headquartered in the quadrant. The quadrant is also home to the city’s arena, which hosts events and the city’s professional basketball team. The quadrant is known for its high-rises and density.\n\n\n\nThe southeast quadrant is primarily an upper-income quadrant and less demographically mixed than the city as a whole. The schools are well-funded and high-performing, the quadrant houses the area’s large university, and the quadrant contains a variety of very high-end retailers and restaurants.\n\n\n\nThe Southwest quadrant is also very mixed income (from very wealthy to very poor) and very demographically mixed. The schools are well-funded and high-performing, and there are a range of businesses from smaller tech firms, a handful of mid-sized manufacturing firms, and the community college and elite STEM college are in the quadrant."
