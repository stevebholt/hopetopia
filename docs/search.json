Your primary campaign focus was increasing housing affordability and attracting businesses back to the Northwest quadrant. In a narrow primary win, the mayor assembled a coalition of support from the Northwest and Northeast quadrants, while a slim advantage in the southwest quadrant made the difference. Below is a summary of the city’s finances."
