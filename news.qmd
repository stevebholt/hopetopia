## The City of Hopetopia Gets a Major Investment
April 3, 2025
Hoptopia - The federal government today announced that two technology manufacturing hubs - one for battery production and one for microchip manufacturing, research, and development - will be funded and established in Hopetopia. Hiring has already begun for five battery manufacturers and three microchip producers. Ground will be broken on the facilities later this year with an expectation that they will be open for operation in the fall of 2026 and fully staffed in 2027. The battery manufacturers announced a forecast of 15,000 new jobs and an additional 5,000 jobs transferred to Hopetopia. The three microchip production companies announced 12,000 new jobs and an additional 1,000 job transfers to Hopetopia from other locations. The city is currently finalizing plans for factory siting throughout the city and additional city responses to the influx of new residents. The manufacturers anticipate all transfers and 30% of the new jobs to be filled by the end of 2026. Analysts have projected that 85% of the new jobs will involve new residents entering Hopetopia. The number of anticipated new jobs in research and development in both battery and chip design is forecasted to be between 5,000 and 10,000 by the end of 2027.

"We welcome this new economic development and look forward to Hopeopia becoming the manufacturing hub for technologies of the future," the mayor said at the press conference announcing the plan.
